Team PERSEVERANCE - Main Repo
2nd Project

Under tp-main/ move project 1 files to a separate folder named /project1/.  Create a new folder called project2 and start your project there.

Exercise:

The task of this project is to replicate a simple static landing page using HTML and CSS. You will receive a picture showing what your design should look like. Feel free to take creative liberty and use your own icons and pictures, but keep formatting the same.

Guidelines: Follow the design shown in the provided layout to display the text, buttons, and images. You are free to use any CSS methods that work for you, use semantic HTML and provide the highest quality code you can produce. 

Mobile Responsiveness: To keep things simple we will only use one breakpoint. For screens under “800 px” in width, all items on the page must appear vertically. For example, in the section that has the text “Wildly effective and Sustainable” the 4 icons under the text must appear stacked on top of each other. All other sections besides the navbar must follow this same principle.

Footer: Add the following text, centered on page: "Start Date Time: XXXX XXXX" where XXXX XXXX is your Team's agreed Start date/time for this project.
The next line will have the text: "End Date Time: XXXX XXXX" which you will update once your project is approved by a TL or PM.

Remember to feel free being as creative as you like with images, icons, etc. but formatting MUST remain the same.
